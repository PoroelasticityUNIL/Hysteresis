# Hysteresis
This File contains the Hysteretic Saturation Fields and the Corresponding Seismic Signatures.
We provide with two folders. The first one, called GitHub_SatFields contains all the information associated with the saturation fields and capillary pressure values during drainage and imbibition processes. The second folder, called GitHub_AttDisp provides with the attenuation and velocity dispersion curves as a function of frequency for the different overall saturation stages analyzed in the manuscript.

For firther question regarding the data please write Dr. Santiago G. Solazzi at: Santiago.Solazzi@unil.ch
