# Hysteresis
This File contains the full data set employed in "Saturation hysteresis effects on the seismic signatures of partially saturated heterogeneous porous rocks". 

We provide with two folders. The first one, called GitHub_SatFields contains all the information associated with the saturation fields and capillary pressure values during drainage and imbibition processes. The second folder, called GitHub_AttDisp provides with the attenuation and velocity dispersion curves as a function of frequency for the different overall saturation stages analyzed in the manuscript.

For further question regarding these files, please write Dr. Santiago G. Solazzi at: Santiago.Solazzi@unil.ch
